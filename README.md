# Python-Challenge

Pybank chanllenge
Import CSV and set the path for data
set variables and counters for profit and loss changes
month over month
print in terminal 
print txt file to correct subfolder had problems at first but found a solution by setting a path as outfile


-- very similiar process in both i struggled getting the 
Pypoll challenge
Had to import CSV files and create a path for the resources
Open in CSV reader
Create lists and counters for the candidates and thier votes
calcualte the percentatge of overall votes and individual percentages
print to terminal the results and then get those results to print to the text file I was getting an error when i tried to get the text file to generate in the analysis folder for both pybank and pypoll but got it to generate in the main folder

**Figured how to change the path on the txt file and fixed the output to populate to the correct folder
